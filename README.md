herein lies builds for:
 BlackParrot: BP
 Hammerblade: HB
 RapidChiplet: RC
as a means for evaluating specific chiplet configurations of two RISC-V chips. 
This configuratoin can be used to determine optimal solutions from offloading deterministic, continous tasks from the coherence engine all the way up to VLM level edge AI chip sets. 

Once optimal solution suggestions are found using rapidChiplet, the integrate booksim and more carefully simulate and verify them.
